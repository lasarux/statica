Statica
=======

A static i18n friendly web builder developed in python using jinja2 
templates and markdown text files (with steroids).

There is an example in this directory in two languages: 
 - spanish (es)
 - catalan (ca)

Run ./statica.py to build the site into build/ directory.

You will need superscript extension in python markdown in orden to 
build the example or remove 'superscript' from extensions and 
replace ^2^ for <sup>2</sup> in resources.

Example site it's a real site, http://lesginestes.com, and it uses
Bootstrap 2.1.0 too.
